# Covid-19 Simulation (Python)

**License:** MIT  **Language:** Python  **Framework:** Streamlit  **Type:** Markov Simulation  

Simulates the spread of COVID-19 using a per-country sampled population and a simple Markov-chain per-person model.  
This project generates individual and country-level time-series data and visualizes infection waves through plots and a Streamlit web app.

## 🧠 Overview

This project models the spread and recovery of COVID-19 in different countries using a probabilistic simulation.  
It operates on a per-person daily simulation model, where each person transitions between different health states based on predefined probabilities.  

The project provides:
- A **detailed daily simulation** for each individual in the sample population.  
- **Aggregated summaries** of infection trends per country.  
- A **visual plot** of infection waves across time.  
- An optional **Streamlit UI** to interactively view and run simulations.

## 📊 Health States (Markov Chain Model)
Each simulated person transitions daily between the following states:
- **H:** Healthy  
- **I:** Infected (no symptoms)  
- **S:** Symptomatic  
- **M:** Immune (recovered)  
- **D:** Deceased  

Transition probabilities and durations are defined in `sim_parameters.py`.

## 🧩 Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `assignment2.py` | Main simulator — implements `run()` for running the full simulation. |
| `app.py` | Streamlit web app for interactive visualization. |
| `helper.py` | Contains plotting helper (`create_plot()`) to generate PNG output. |
| `sim_parameters.py` | Defines transition probabilities and holding times per age group. |
| `test.py` | Driver script that runs the simulation with sample inputs. |
| `a2-countries.csv` | Input data for country demographics. |

## 📦 Outputs

Running the simulation generates the following files:
- `a2-covid-simulated-timeseries.csv` — Detailed per-person/day/state simulation results.  
- `a2-covid-summary-timeseries.csv` — Aggregated counts per country/day for each state (H, I, S, M, D).  
- `a2-covid-simulation.png` — Visualization plot created by `helper.py::create_plot()`.

## ⚙️ Quick Setup (Local)

### 1. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```
### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or manually:
pip install pandas matplotlib streamlit
```
### 3. Run the simulation
```bash
python assignment2.py
```
### 4. Run the Streamlit app (interactive)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Then open: http://localhost:8501
## Example Usage

Simulate the spread of COVID-19 for the countries:
["Afghanistan", "Sweden", "Japan"]
over the period 2021-04-01 → 2022-04-30 with a sample ratio of 1e6.

The resulting CSV and PNG files will be saved in the project directory.
